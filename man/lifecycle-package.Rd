\title{lifecycle: Manage the Life Cycle of your Package Functions}
\description{
Manage the life cycle of your exported functions with
    shared conventions, documentation badges, and non-invasive
    deprecation warnings. The 'lifecycle' package defines four
    development stages (experimental, stable, questioning, and
    superseded) and three deprecation stages (soft-deprecated,
    deprecated, and defunct). It makes it easy to insert badges
    corresponding to these stages in your documentation. Usage of
    deprecated functions are signalled with increasing levels of
    non-invasive verbosity.
